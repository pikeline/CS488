Notes on Building menu by assigning strings to innerHTML

// You can conjure HTML by assigning raw HTML code to the innerHTML of some HTML object

window.onload = function() {
  var html_obj = document.getElementById('block');
  var url = "https://www.google.com";
  
  html_obj.innerHTML = html_obj.innerHTML + '<a href="' + url + '">click me</a>';
}

/*
However, this is very Inefficient.
After each new assignment, the entire innerHTML has to be re-parsed into chunk of DOM tree.
That means if you are conjuring elements in this way inside a loop (like building a list, table, or group of form elements)
Each pass of the loop causes a re-parse of ALL the code inside the HTML object, even the stuff that was added on previous passes.
