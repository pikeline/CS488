  <b>JavaScript Runtime Environment:</b> Persists as long as page is loaded - could be days.
  <br>
  <b>Examples:</b> V8 (Google Chrome, Opera, NodeJS), Nitro (Apple Safari), Chakra (Microsoft), SpiderMonkey (Open Source Mozilla, Firefox)
  <br>
  Most (all?) of these are written in C++.
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="js_runtime_environment_diagram.svg" width="295" height="271" alt="" style="float:left;margin-right:5px;">
  <b>Event Queue:</b> First in, first out - Main execution thread in Runtime Environment
  <br>
  <b>Event Loop:</b> Looks every Millisecond at front of Queue for a message to execute.
  <br>
  <b>Message:</b> A function that needs called - events result in new messages (callback functions) being pushed onto end of Event Queue to await their turns.
  <br>
  <b>Call Stack:</b> Stack (first in, last out) for function executions, just like for any running process.
  <br><br>
  <b>Main (initial) Script Execution:</b> Top down parsing of all JS (in &lt;script&gt; tags and/or external script files).
  Think of this as top-down execution of <code>main()</code> function in Java.
  <br><br>
  Initial code in Main script (think main()) is pushed into the Event Queue to execute.
  <br>
  After that, event callbacks start being added to the Event Queue, starting with the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event.
  <br>
  User triggered events come in order after that.
  <br><br>
  See source code and console to demonstrate.
  <br>
  Also, load this page into a new tab (with console already open) to see that the page is rendered after Main script execution (right before <code>window.onload</code> event).
  Reloading in an existing tab is different.
