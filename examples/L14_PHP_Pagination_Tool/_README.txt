This example will ONLY work when added to my app_framework_orm example.
Add both php files included with this example to your app_framework_orm folder. 

The original listing page just made an HTML table. 

This one uses the listing tool implemented by this file: class_pageable_list.php
  
The tool allows you to (among other things):
  Enable pagination (show X results per page)
  Sort by Column Headers
  Create Custom Column Functionality
