# The Apache Web server (if configured to do so) automatically reads files named .htaccess
# Such files contain instructions to be executed by the server during http(s) requests.

# A .htaccess file only affects the directory it's in, plus any subdirectories.
# A .htaccess file in the root directory (e.g. public_html) of a web site, will affect the entire site, including subfolders.
# This .htaccess file is in the folder containing these API examples, so it won't affect any other requests outside the api folder.

  #####
  # Set the base path for the API script using the rewrite
  # Leave out public_html, since Apache automatically resolves /~username/ to /~username/public_html/

  RewriteBase /~knuckles/csci488/api/


  #####
  # Set a RewriteCond condition to ONLY rewrite requests that appear to be for a directory - like api/dog
  # The !-f says to ignore actual files - so won't rewrite requests to other files (like the API clients

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f


  #####
  # Rewrites a URL like /~knuckles/csci488/api/dog to be /~knuckles/csci488/api/2_api_data.php?query=dog

  RewriteRule ^(.+)$ 2_api_data.php?query=$1 [QSA,NC]


  # The first stuff is a Regular Expression (Regex).  Regex is used for pattern matching.
  # ^ means start and $ means end
  # () means capture a match inside, which populates the variable $1 with the match
  # . is a wildcard that matches any character
  # + is a quantifier that means "1 or more"

  # We could use (.*), where * is a quantifier that means "0 or more"
  # That would mean the rewrite rule would match only /~knuckles/api/ which would send an empty string to the API

  # The things at the end are called Flags.
  # QSA is Query String Append.
  # NC is No Case -- case insensitive matching
