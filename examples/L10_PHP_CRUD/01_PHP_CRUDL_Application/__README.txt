This example implements CRUDL operations and is structured as a small PHP application.

The init.php file does things that all files in the App will need.
  It's required at the top of each PHP script that generates a Web page.

PHP scripts that generate Web pages begin with page_
The other PHP files are part of the application structure.

The file containing the HTML form for person data also handles all the CRUD operations.
  This is a good organizational tactic - the form that collects a certain type of data
  and the CRUD operations on that data are consolidated into one file.
