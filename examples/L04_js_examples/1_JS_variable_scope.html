/*
  Global variables exist in the RAM for as log as the page (script) is loaded in the browser.

  You don't have to use the var keyword when defining global variables.
  But it is considered good practice.
*/

let a = 'a';//block scope
var x = 'x';//function scope
y = 'y';//global scope

console.log(x); // OK
console.log(y); // OK

/*
  You can force Strict Mode by putting the following line at the top of a script,

  "use strict";

  In strict mode, the variable y would technically not exist in the global scope.

  console.log(y); // Error because y was not formally declared

  Most "casual" JS scripters do not use strict mode.
*/


/*
  Global Variables are actually properties of the window object.
*/

console.log(window.x);  // same as console.log(x)
console.log(window.y);  // same as console.log(y)

/*
  For local variables, the var keyword is much more important.
*/

function f(a) {   // input parameters are local variables

  var b = 'b';    // local variable - only exists during function call
  c = 'c';        // global variable - - exists after function call

}

f('a');  // function call

//console.log(a); // Error Not defined
//console.log(b); // Error Not defined
console.log(c); // OK - global variable was initialized in the function but still exists


for (var i = 0 ; i <= 100 ; i++) {
  /*
   If you declare i using var, the loop counter will exist ONLY during the loop.
   Otherwise, without var, the loop counter would exist in the global scope after the loop is done.
