Here are some rules and some hints:

1)
Do not break the JSON into smaller objects. Part of this assignment is learning to understand complex JSON structures.
The JSON string below is a multidimensional array of objects, a typical format for JSON data.

You can copy and paste it into your script.
The JSON is a one line string.  Your code editor has a setting where you can turn soft wrap on and off.

JSON.parse() it into an object.
If you write the resulting JSON object to the JS console, you will more clearly see the structure of the data.

[{"animal_id":4,"animal_type":"dog","animal_breeds":[{"breed_id":1,"breed_name":"Beagle"},{"breed_id":2,"breed_name":"Poodle"},{"breed_id":3,"breed_name":"Hound"},{"breed_id":4,"breed_name":"Collie"}]},{"animal_id":7,"animal_type":"cat","animal_breeds":[{"breed_id":1,"breed_name":"Tabby"},{"breed_id":2,"breed_name":"Calico"},{"breed_id":3,"breed_name":"Persian"}]},{"animal_id":11,"animal_type":"bat","animal_breeds":[{"breed_id":1,"breed_name":"Hoary"},{"breed_id":2,"breed_name":"Egyptian Fruit"},{"breed_id":3,"breed_name":"Spotted"},{"breed_id":4,"breed_name":"Leaf-nosed"}]},{"animal_id":17,"animal_type":"rat","animal_breeds":[{"breed_id":1,"breed_name":"Sewer"},{"breed_id":2,"breed_name":"Bilge"},{"breed_id":3,"breed_name":"Dirty"}]}]

2)
Do not change the id values. This simulates data that would be pulled from a database. The id's would be the database identifiers (primary keys).

3)
Here's some help with dealing with HTML form elements.


Select Menu
---------------------------------------------

The HTML  (just a hardcoded sample)
For dynamically generated menu, it would be better to assign the event handler with JavaScript.

<select onchange="my_callback(this)">
  <option value="">make a selection</option>
  <option value="22">aardvark</option>
<select>

The JS

function my_callback(menu_obj) {
  alert("The value of the currently chosen menu item is " + menu_obj.value);
  alert("The value of the currently chosen menu item is " + menu_obj.options[menu_obj.selectedIndex].text);
}




Radio Buttons:
---------------------------------------------

The HTML (just a hardcoded sample -- would be dynamically generated from the JSON data)

<input type="radio" name="animals" value="1" onclick="my_callback(this)"> dog
<br>
<input type="radio" name="animals" value="2" onclick="my_callback(this)"> cat

The JS

function my_callback(radio_obj) {
  var chosen_value = radio_obj.value;
  // This is the hidden value of the chosen radio button, 2 if cat is selected
  if (radio_obj.checked) {
    // do something
  }
}
