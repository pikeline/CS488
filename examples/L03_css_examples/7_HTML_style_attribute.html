    The addresses below look quite similar when rendered, with the exception of the last one.

    You need to look at the HTML/CSS source code to see what this example is about.

    <!--  
      The one below is from the the "Old School HTML" example from the lesson that introduced CSS.
      It's bad to have the presentation instructions (color&font) mixed in with the HTML markup.
      That's why the font container has been deprecated since about 2000.
      YUK - NOBODY CODES LIKE THIS any more.  But you still see stuff like this in very old Web pages.

      <b>Bryan Moore</b>
    </font>

    <font size="3" color="#666666" face="Geneva">
      1234 Sunset Ave<br>
      Columbus, OH 12345<br>
      (123) 123-4567
    </font>   
    
    <br><br>
    
    <!--  
      The one below shows why CSS is much better.
      You've learned enough CSS at this point to fully appreciate that.
    -->
    
    <div class="person">
      Bryan Moore
    </div>
    <div class="address">
      1234 Sunset Ave<br>
      Columbus, OH 12345<br>
      (123) 123-4567
    </div>

    <!--  
      The one below is the main point of this example.
      The style attribute is a UNIVERSAL HTML attribute (can be used in any HTML element).
      Styles applied in this way are called "Inline Styles".
      That term has nothing to do with inline vs block HTML elements.
      Rather, it means you are applying the styles inline with the HTML code.
      
      <element style="CSS properties"></element> 
      
      Inline styles can be applied to any HTML element (inline or block).
      
      You should generally avoid using inline styles much, if at all. 
      The address just above took a major step forward in removing presentation details from the HTML code.
      The one below seems to take a step backwards and looks more like the first one in this example. 
      
      To achieve the separation of labor that makes CSS so flexible and powerful, you should put 
      almost all of your CSS in style sheets (internal or external) and NOT inline with the HTML like below.
    -->
    
    <div style="color: #999999; font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; font-weight: bold;">
      Bryan Moore
    </div>
    <div style="color: #666666; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Geneva;">
      1234 Sunset Ave<br>
      Columbus, OH 12345<br>
      (123) 123-4567
    </div>
    
    <br>
    
   <!--  
      The final example below shows how inline styles are sometimes used to "tweak" an HTML element.
      If you have lots of names/addresses formatted by these style classes,
      it's easy to emphasize one of them like below by "tweaking" it with inline styles.
      
      An alternative would be to make a second style class (e.g. person2) that sets a different text color.  
      If only a couple names need "tweaked" for emphasis, using inline styles like below might be preferable 
      to making an entire new person2 class that's identical to the person class except for the color. 

      The moral of all this?  Inline styles can be useful for tweaking things but they should be used
      sparingly, not for bulk application of styles.
