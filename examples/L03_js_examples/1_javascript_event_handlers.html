    // Functions that are called by events are often called "callback functions"

    // Callback function for the link1 click event
    // The event handler is set as an HTML attribute in the HTML code

    function myfunction() {
    
      // Tangible reactions to the event
      alert("Link 1 has been clicked!");
      console.log("Link 1 has been clicked!");
      
      // Usually the reaction is some change to the Web page, but these are good during development 
      // just to make sure the events are firing and the callback function is being called.

      // var some_object = document.getElementById("some_id");
      // This would be OK since myfunction() can't is called by an event AFTER the page is finished loading.

      Callback function for the page onload event.
      The onload event is fired automatically by the browser when the page has finished loading.
      At that point, all the DOM objects are fully initialized.

    window.onload = function() {
      
      console.log("The web page is fully loaded.");
      
      // Can't do this until the DOM is initialized -- would get null object
      var link2_object = document.getElementById("link2");

      // Callback function for the link2 click event

      link2_object.onclick = function () {
        alert("Link 2 has been clicked!");

    /*
      Notice the notation for the two callback functions for the onload and link2 events.
      They have no names! Hence they are called "Anonymous Functions".
    */
    
    /*
      The window.onload actually doesn't fire until the entire web page is completely loaded
      meaning all graphics, etc. For a heavy page, that can take a while. 
      
      However, the DOMContentLoaded event fires as soon as the browser has finished initializing the DOM, 
      which is typically BEFORE the window.onload event fires.
      But browsers don't expose document.DOMContentLoaded as a property, so you have to set the 
      DOMContentLoaded event on the document object using the addEventListener() method.

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      console.log('The DOM is fully initialized!');

  <h2>JavaScript Event Handlers Terminology and Examples</h2>

  You have to read the source code to see what this example is about.

  <br><br>

  <a href="#null" onclick="myfunction()">Link 1</a>
  <br><br>
  <a href="#null" id="link2">Link 2</a>

  <!--
    Setting href="#null" is a common way to make a link that does nothing so that you can rig it with a custom event handler.
