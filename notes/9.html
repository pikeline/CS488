    <title>REST API</title>
</head>
<body>
    It was first theorized by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.<br>
    REST stands for Representational State Transfer.<br>
    It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.<br>

    We are going to create a php script. This script will be a REST API.<br>
    The system is going to give a http request to the server. The server will then decide what to do when it hits the rest api. It can interface with a db. It is called rest since it transfers the state of the database. It will then give a reply with JSON data. The client will then parse the JSON and data. <br>

    The examples have to be run on a server with php installed.<br>

    Headers go into the http requests. It describes data. <br>
    For example, content-type: application/json<br>
    This can be used to tell the client what type of data is being sent. and what to do with it.<br>
    When you get a http request, you get a response. In the response, there is a preamble and a payload. The payload can be html or json. <br>
    The preamble is the headers. <br>
    They tell the browser what they are getting, etc, etc. <br>

    Mime types are used to tell the browser what type of data is being sent. <br>
    For example, text/html, application/json, etc. <br>
    Mime stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. <br>
    They were built in the 70s to help send emails. <br>
    Headers are an associative array, with a key and a value. <br>

    If the apache webserver requests a file in the directory, if there is a .htaccess file, it will read it first<br>
    You can rewrite the url. For example, /cat can be rewritten to /index.php?name=cat<br>

    You can also put redirects in there, etc. <br>

    It's a way to tell apache to do stuff at request time before it gets to the file. <br>

    <h1>Within API.php</h1>
    First thing to set are the headers. <br>
    The headers are set with the header() function. <br>
    They are content-type: application/json. <br>
    This is a mime type. <br>
    We also set CORS : * <br>
    CORS is Cross Origin Resource Sharing. <br>
    This is a security feature. It should be ok if browser is not associated with different domain. <br>
    However, we generally consume api data with some other client. If that client is on a different domain, it will not work. <br>
    That is why you need to set CORS to * <br>
    If you want to set it to a specific domain, you can do that too. <br>
    ex: CORS: y.com allows y.com to access the api. <br>
    Next, we want to process our request. <br>
    For our homework, we need to process 3 different get requests. <br>
    One for work, one to get acts and scenes, and one to get the lines. <br>
    Next, we hit the database for data.<br>
    In PHP, we get a result set. We need to loop over the return set. <br>
    We need to form a php data structure that we can convert to JSON. <br>
    Then, we are gonna echo the JSON data. <br>
    Finally, we are going to exit. <br>

    This data can be consumed by a client with file_get_contents() or curl. <br>

    <h1>Shakespear DB</h1>
    Works table: work_id, title, long title, year, genre)<br>
    Chapters table: chapter_id pk, work_id fk, act, scene, description) work id is a foreign key to works table. It is a one to many relationship.<br>
    Alternatively, the work id, act, and scene can be a composite key. <br>
    Paragraphs table: paragraph_id pk, work_id fk, act, scene, number, character fk, text) <br>
    The work id, act, scene, and number can be a composite key. <br>
    The work id is a foreign key to the works table. <br>
    The character is a foreign key to the characters table. <br>
    It isn't necessary for the homework maybe. <br>
    The call can be detected with isset($_GET['work']) <br>
    It can be used to populate an enum. That enum in a switch statement decides what is sent. <br>

    To populate the rows, you can use a while loop. <br>
    $works = []; <br>
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) { <br>
        $data[] = $row; <br>
    } <br>

    Then, you can echo json_encode($data); <br>

    In php you can do <br>
    #a = []; <br>
    #a[] = 1; <br>
    #a[] = 2; <br>
    This is the shorthand for array_push. <br>
    It assigns it to an empty array, then pushes the values. <br>

    Ex: <br>
    $a['a'] = 1;<br>
    $a['b'] = 2;<br>
    Json_encode will give an object. <br>
    Json_encode($a) will give {"a":1,"b":2} <br>
    In PHP, objects and associative arrays are the same. <br>
    You can also do this with 2d arrays. Ex: $a[0][] = 1; $a[0][] = 2; $a[1][] = 3; $a[1][] = 4; <br>
    This will give [[1,2],[3,4]] <br>
