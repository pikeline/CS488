    <title>REST API</title>
</head>
<body>
    It was first theorized by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.<br>
    REST stands for Representational State Transfer.<br>
    It is an architectural style for designing networked applications.<br>

    We are going to create a php script. This script will be a REST API.<br>
    The system is going to give a http request to the server. The server will then decide what to do when it hits the rest api. It can interface with a db. It is called rest since it transfers the state of the database. It will then give a reply with JSON data. The client will then parse the JSON and data. <br>

    The examples have to be run on a server with php installed.<br>

    Headers go into the http requests. It describes data. <br>
    For example, content-type: application/json<br>
    This can be used to tell the client what type of data is being sent. and what to do with it.<br>
