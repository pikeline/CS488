<body>
A web browser, internally, parses html into a parse tree.<br>

The head has the title and meta tags, while the body has different tags.<br>
For example, the body can have a div tag, which can have a p tag, which can have a span tag, which can have a text node.<br>
If it sees links, it will make a request to the server to get the resources.<br>
Then, it will render the page.<br>

<br>&lt;div> - generic block
<br>&lt;span> - generic inline

When you load a webpage from a server, it loads it into a chunk of memory called a cache.<br>
The cache is a temporary storage area for frequently accessed data that is used to speed up the process of retrieving data.<br>

External vs internal vs inline styles<br>

external is in a stylesheet that is linked to the html file<br>

internal is in the head of the html file<br>

inline is in the tag itself<br>

CSS<br>

selector selects the items you want to style<br>

there are different types: element, class, id, attribute, pseudo-class, pseudo-element<br>

the css properties are the styles you want to apply to the selected items<br>

they are determined by specificity and document order, with specificity taking precedence<br>

Regarding document order, if a spreadsheet is linked to the html file with internal styles, the properties is determined by document order.<br>

Ex: link to spreadsheet then internal styles, the internal styles will overwrite any shared properties.<br>

Every html element has default CSS style.<br>

Let's say 4 selectors select the same element.<br>
    - all properties will be applied<br>
    - what if 2 selectors select the same property? The most specific one will be applied. Then, if they are the same, document order wins.<br>
