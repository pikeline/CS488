    CRUDL - Create, Read, Update, Delete, List<br>
    Create - INSERT INTO table (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...)<br>
    Read - SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = value<br>
    Update - UPDATE table SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE column = value<br>
    Delete - DELETE FROM table WHERE column = value<br>
    List - SELECT * FROM table<br>

    The form data should have a hidden input field  called task, which passes a value called save, delete, edit, or blank(default) and a field called name with a value of id, which is the primary key if it exists (empty if new, existing if upgrade). In the serverside, there is a switch statement that checks the value of task and performs the appropriate action.<br>
    save cleans the data, then either inserts or updates the data in the database.<br>
    Finally, feedback is given.<br>
