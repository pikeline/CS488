    <h1>More Jquery</h1>
    $() grabs an object. It can be specified by $("#id")<br>
    $("#id").html() is a getter<br>
    $("#id").html("dog") is a setter<br>
    $("div") selects and grabs all of the divs, and<br>
    $("div").each(callback) is a callback function, which fires an event for each div<br>
    A callback is a function that is bound to an event handler. It is executed when the event is triggered<br>
    <h1>AJAX</h1>
    AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML<br>
    AJAX requests are made using the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) browser object<br>
    The hard part of XHR are the status codes.<br>
    JQuery made XHR easier with AJAX.<br>
    There is also the fetch() API, which came out in 2017<br>
    With AJAX, you can make requests to a server without reloading the page<br>
    AJAX takes a JSON object and sends it to the server<br>
    The server processes the JSON object and sends a response back to the client<br>
    The client processes the response and updates the page<br>
