    <title>AJAX</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>More Jquery</h1>
    $() grabs an object. It can be specified by $("#id")<br>
    $("#id").html() is a getter<br>
    $("#id").html("dog") is a setter<br>
    $("div") selects and grabs all of the divs, and<br>
    $("div").each(callback) is a callback function, which fires an event for each div<br>
    A callback is a function that is bound to an event handler. It is executed when the event is triggered<br>
    <h1>AJAX</h1>
    AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML<br>
    AJAX requests are made using the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) browser object<br>
    The hard part of XHR are the status codes.<br>
    JQuery made XHR easier with AJAX.<br>
    There is also the fetch() API, which came out in 2017<br>
    With AJAX, you can make requests to a server without reloading the page<br>
    AJAX takes a JSON object and sends it to the server<br>
    The server processes the JSON object and sends a response back to the client<br>
    The client processes the response and updates the page<br>
    
    <br>
    Sidenote: jquery siblings() = parent().children()<br>

    <h1>More AJAX</h1>
    Loading a webpage begins with a synchronous transaction<br>
    The browser sends a request to the server, and the server sends a response back<br>
    If the user fires an event, the browser sends another request to the server asynchronously<br>
    This means the user can interact with the page while the server is processing the request<br>
    The server sends a response back to the client as JSON, and the client updates the page<br>

    <h1>Arrow functions</h1>
    Arrow functions are a shorthand way to write functions<br>
    They are anonymous functions<br>
    () => {} is the syntax<br>
    It is the same as function() {}<br>
    Arrow functions do not have their own this<br>
    They inherit the this from the parent scope<br>
    You don't always have to use return with arrow functions<br>
    If you have a single line of code, you can omit the curly braces<br>
    If you have a single parameter, you can omit the parentheses<br>
    For example: x => x * x<br>
    That is the same as function(x) { return x * x; }<br>

    <h1>Associative arrays</h1>
    Associative arrays are objects in JavaScript<br>
    In Python, they are called dictionaries<br>
