Javascript - Vanilla edition<br>

Vanilla javascript is javascript without any libraries or frameworks.<br>

W3C controls HTML, CSS. ECMAScript controls Javascript.<br>

The current version of Javascript is 6.<br>

Javascript is loosely typed, which means you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it.<br>
ex:<br>
var x;<br>
x = 10;<br>
x = "hello";<br>
<br>
it doesn't care<br>
<br>
while, Java is strongly typed, which means you have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it.<br>
ex:<br>
int x;<br>
<br>
javascript is interprited on the fly, which means it is executed line by line.<br>
Java is compiled, which means it is converted to machine code before it is executed.<br>

fundamentally, javascript runs at load time<br>

or on an event like onload, onclick, etc.<br>

click is a user event<br>

onload is a page/automatic event<br>

javascript is most often used for custom reaction to user events <br>
for example:<br>

a onclick = "f()"><br>

^<br>

function f(){<br>
    alert("hello");<br>
}<br>
