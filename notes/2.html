        Javascript - Vanilla edition<br>

        Vanilla javascript is javascript without any libraries or frameworks.<br>

        W3C controls HTML, CSS. ECMAScript controls Javascript.<br>

        The current version of Javascript is 6.<br>

        Javascript is loosely typed, which means you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you declare
        it.<br>
        ex:<br>
        var x;<br>
        x = 10;<br>
        x = "hello";<br>
        <br>
        it doesn't care<br>
        <br>
        while, Java is strongly typed, which means you have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it.<br>
        ex:<br>
        int x;<br>
        <br>
        javascript is interprited on the fly, which means it is executed line by line.<br>
        Java is compiled, which means it is converted to machine code before it is executed.<br>

        fundamentally, javascript runs at load time<br>

        or on an event like onload, onclick, etc.<br>

        click is a user event<br>

        onload is a page/automatic event<br>

        javascript is most often used for custom reaction to user events <br>
        for example:<br>

        a onclick = "f()"><br>

        ^<br>

        function f(){<br>
        alert("hello");<br>
        }<br>
    </div>
    <div>
        if you do something like: (inspect element)<br>
        <script>
            var a = 10; //exists outside
            if (true) {
                var b = 1;//also exists outside
                let c = 10;//exists only inside the block
            }
        </script>
        Historically, JS talked with the browser's API for client side scripting. It is used for more now.
        <br>
        Script = code to control an app
        <br>
        Code = making the app
        <br>
        JS made the jump to server side with Node JS. It was the original server side library.<br>
        http(s) is called a stateless protocol. It doesn't remember anything about the client.<br>
        The client sends a request, the server sends a response, and then forgets about the client.<br>
        If the client needs something, it asks the server, the server sends it, then the server closes the requests.
        <br>
        There is no lasting connection<br>
        Client pull means the client dictates the request, and the server responds.<br>
        Nowadays, there is websockets, which is a two way connection.<br>
        It is called websocket secure because it is encrypted.<br>
        It is a stateful, bi-directional protocol aka server push and client pull.<br>
        So, when a webpage loads, it can keep the connection open and the server can push data to the client.<br>
        <br>
        Javascript was invented by Netscape browser. They also invented cookies, which is a little chunk of data set by
        the browser.<br>
        <br>
        Every browser has a javascript engine. Chrome has V8, Firefox has SpiderMonkey, and Edge has Chakra.<br>
        <br>
        Errors are dumped to the console.<br>
        <h1>Sequence of events when a Page loads</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Load time execution.<br>
                This sets up event handlers and other initial tasks like creating connections
            </li>
            <li>
                document.DOMContentLoaded event<br>
                DOM becomes fully initialized and loaded. You can not access html objects before this.
            </li>
            <li>
                window.onload<br>
                This is when the page is fully loaded. You can access all html objects now.
            </li>
            <li>
                Event loop<br>
                This is a loop that checks every millisecond for events. It is always running.
            </li>
        </ol>
        HTML objects are every element in the page. They are stored in a tree structure.<br>
        DHTML is dynamic HTML. It refers to manipulating the DOM with javascript.<br>
        => you can do dynamic things in pages.<br>
        It was a marketing term.<br>

        <br>
        When a function is tied to an event, it is called a callback function.<br>
        These can be named or anonymous.<br>
        Anonymous functions are functions without a name.<br>

        <h1>What can you change about an HTML object</h1>
        You can change it's content, style, and class.<br>
        ex:<br>
        obj.innerHTML = "new content";<br>
        obj.style.backgroundColor = "red";<br>
        obj.className = "new_class";<br>
        Note: "new_class" must pre_exist in the style sheet.<br>
        <br>
        You can use the ability to modify styles to adfd animations to a page.<br>
        Ex: add 1 pixel to the width of a div every 10 milliseconds.<br>
        <h1>Browser objects</h1>
        window<br>
        history<br>
        location<br>
        navigator (read only)<br>
        screen (read only)<br>
        math<br>
        date<br>
        JSON<br>
        window can have methods like open(), resizeto(), etc.<br>
        history has methods like back(), forward(), go(), etc.<br>
        The navigator object has properties like appName, appVersion, etc.<br>
        It gives information about the browser.<br>
