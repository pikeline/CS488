    For this class, we will be using a database located at https://csci.lakeforest.edu/cscidbgui with username csci488_fall24 and password writeCode24 <br>
    You can store arrays in a database by using the JSON data type or by serializing the array into a string with some delimiter.<br>
    In PHP, implode() is used to join array elements with a string and explode() is used to split a string into an array.<br>
    You can also use serialize() and unserialize() to convert an array into a string and back.<br>
    The process of converting an object into a string is called serialization and the process of converting a string back into an object is called deserialization.<br>
    PHP has a now() function that returns the current date and time.<br>
    You can use the date() function to format a date and time string.<br>
    now() is a unix timestamp that represents the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.<br>
    This can be stored as a timestamp or an integer.
    In mySQL, int is a 4-byte integer, bigint is an 8-byte integer, and tinyint is a 1-byte integer.<br>
    a 4-byte integer can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.<br>
    This is the same as 2^31 - 1.<br>
    The min and max values for a 1-byte integer are -128 and 127.<br>
    This is the same as 2^7 - 1.<br>
