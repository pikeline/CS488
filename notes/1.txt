A web browser, internally, parses html into a parse tree.

The head has the title and meta tags, while the body has different tags. 
For example, the body can have a div tag, which can have a p tag, which can have a span tag, which can have a text node.
If it sees links, it will make a request to the server to get the resources.
Then, it will render the page.

<div> - generic block
<span> - generic inline

When you load a webpage from a server, it loads it into a chunk of memory called a cache.
The cache is a temporary storage area for frequently accessed data that is used to speed up the process of retrieving data.

External vs internal vs inline styles

external is in a stylesheet that is linked to the html file

internal is in the head of the html file

inline is in the tag itself

CSS

selector selects the items you want to style

there are different types: element, class, id, attribute, pseudo-class, pseudo-element

the css properties are the styles you want to apply to the selected items

they are determined by specificity and document order, with specificity taking precedence

Regarding document order, if a spreadsheet is linked to the html file with internal styles, the properties is determined by document order.

Ex: link to spreadsheet then internal styles, the internal styles will overwrite any shared properties.

Every html element has default CSS style.

Let's say 4 selectors select the same element.
    - all properties will be applied
    - what if 2 selectors select the same property? The most specific one will be applied. Then, if they are the same, document order wins.
