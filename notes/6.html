    ReactJS is a CSR (Client Side Rendering) library that is used to build user interfaces.<br>
    It uses JSX, which is JSXML, a syntax extension of JavaScript.<br>
    JSX is a syntax that allows HTML to be written in JavaScript and placed in the same file.<br>
    It must be legit XML, like self-closing tags and lowercase tag names.<br>
    Also, the tags must be closed in the proper order.<br>
    <br>
    For example, the following code snippet is a React component that renders a simple greeting:<br>
    <pre>
        import React from 'react';
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

        function Greeting() {
            return <>
                Hello, World! <br>
                Hi!
            <>;
        }

        ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root'));
    </pre>
    React creates a Virtual DOM parse tree that is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.<br>
    When the state of the Virtual DOM changes, React compares the Virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only updates the parts that have changed.<br>
    The Javascript html is used to build a Virtual DOM tree.<br>
    React also has a global state.<br>
    It gives the current state of a component<br>
    User events are a change in the global state.<br>
    The react virtual dom has something called react hooks, which are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.<br>
    <br>
    Events are caused by user actions like clicking a button or typing in a form or web sockets.<br>
    Web sockets allow servers to push data to clients in real time.<br>
    When there is a change, react builds a new virtual dom and compares it to the old one.<br>
    It then updates the actual dom with the changes using the React Fiber algorithm.<br>
    This is different from shadow DOM, which is a way to create a separate DOM tree that is hidden from the main DOM.<br>
    For example, the video element in HTML uses shadow DOM.<br>
    The controls are in the shadow DOM and are not accessible to the main DOM.<br>
