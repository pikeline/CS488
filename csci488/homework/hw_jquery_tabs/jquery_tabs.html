  <!--

    Instructions:
    Edit the jquery_nav.js file to automatically turn the HTML marked as tab systems into show/hide tab systems.

    DO NOT:
    Edit the CSS or HTML files provided with this assignment.

    ONLY:
    Edit the JS file.

    ALSO:
    - Your JS should NOT change the HTML that's not marked as tab systems. Only the stuff marked with tab- attributes should change.

    - The there are two distinct chunks of HTML marked as distinct tab systems: cities and animals.
      Your JS has to work for any number of distinct tab systems that might be in the page, regardless of their names (or order in the page).
      That is, YOU CAN'T use the words cities or animals in your code.

    RATIONALE:
    Obviously, the attributes beginning with tab- in the HTML are NOT part of the HTML language.

    This example is inspired by CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.
    Such frameworks invent their own HTML attributes to induce special formatting and functionality.
    The JS looks for the framework-specific attributes and supplles the necessary magic to deliver the functionality.
    In this HW, you have to supply the magic!!!!!!

<div tab-controls="cities">
  <button id="london">London</button>
  <button id="paris">Paris</button>
  <button id="tokyo" tab-default-active>Tokyo</button>

<div tab-controls="animals">
  <button id="cat">Cats</button>
  <button id="dog">Dogs</button>
  <button id="rat">Rats</button>
</div>

<div tab-content="animals">
  <p tab-content-for="cat">If cats could text you, they wouldn't.</p>
  <p tab-content-for="dog">If dogs could text you, they would do so constantly.</p>
  <p tab-content-for="rat">If rats could text you, it would be a phishing scam.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <button>Should</button>
  <button>Not</button>
  <button>Change</button>
</div>

<div>
  <p>This stuff should not be changed by your JS because it's not marked as a tab system.</p>
  <p>The two tab systems above should end up with the functionality shown below.</p>
